# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this assignment was to get more in depth with unsupervised learning and process crypto data using principal component analysis. Becuase crypto is such a risky investment, unsupervised learning will be the appropriate method to try and find patterns in the data. 

At the end of the assignment, we were to create visuals(plots and charts) to have a visual understanding of our data.

* The scatter chart above shows that there are 4 clusters and the coins are divided into the four clusters accordingly. 
* Now that we have this result, we can then use supervised learning to dig deeper into the data and make accureate investment predictions.
